Formatting colour in CSS and Background and Text Colour in CSS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formatting colour in CSS involves specifying colours for various elements of a webpage to enhance its visual appearance.

Specifying colour values:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Colours in CSS can be specified using various formats including hexadecimal(hex) notation(‘#RRGGBB’), RGB values (‘rgb9r, g, b)’), RGBA values (‘rgba (r, g, b, a)’), HSL values (g, s%, l%)’) and named colours.
•	Hexadecimal notation is the most commonly used format and represents colours using a combination of red (R), green (G), and blue (B), values in hexadecimal (base 16) format.

Background colour:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Background-colour: an element tag can be specified by using CSS background colour attribute.
•	Users can set a solid background colour for elements like divs, sections, and the full webpage body because it supports a variety of colour value formats.
•	Example: background-colour: #ff0000; sets the background colour to red.

Text colour:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Colour property: text colour element in CSS can be specified using the CSS attribute.
•	Users can set the colour of text content within elements using t, which accepts the same colour value formats as background-colour.
•	Example: colour: #ffffff; sets the text colour to white.

Usage: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Background and text colours are commonly used in web design to create visually appealing layouts, highlights important content and improve readability.
•	They can be applied to various HTML elements such as <div>, <p> paragraphs, <h1> headings and links <a> anchor among others.
To summarize, the process of formatting colour in CSS entails utilizing distinct colour value formats to express background and text colours.

Understanding Images in CSS and Working with Background Images in CSS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding images in CSS involves knowing how to incorporate and manipulate images within a web page layout.

Using images in CSS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	CSS allows images in web pages using properties like “background-image” and “content”
•	The background-image property sets one or more background image for an element while the content property can insert images into generated content such as pseudo- elements (: :before”, :: after”).
•	Images can be directly inserted int HTML using the <img> element with CSS used to style and position them.

Working with background images:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Background images are often used for decorative or visual elements behind other content.
•	Background-image property is used to specify the URL of the image to be used as a background
•	Other properties like “background-repeat”, “background-size”, “background-position”, and “background-attachment” control how the image is displayed, repeated, sized, positioned and scrolled with content
•	Background images can be set to repeat, cover the entire background area, fixed in place or scaled to fit within the container.

Responsive background image:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	To make the background image responsive, use percentage values for “background-size” or the “cover” value which scales the image to cover the entire container while maintaining aspect ratio.
•	Media queries can be used to adjust background image based on viewpoint size or device characteristics.

Optimize:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Using correctly sized and compressed pictures is crucial to maximizing the performance of your webpage.
•	Formats like JPEG, PNG and WebP are commonly used for images, each with its own compression and quality settings.
•	Resizing and compressing photos for the web can be done with the aid of programs like image editors, image optimization tools, or internet services.

In conclusion, learning about images in CSS include learning how to work with background images for layout and design, as well as how to integrate photos using values like background-image and content. To create effective and aesthetically pleasing web sites, images must be optimized for efficiency and responsiveness.
